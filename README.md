## Concept

A tool designed to help understand image composition in terms of **visual weight**, **eye movement**, and **balance**. Using computer vision, it offers insights into how an image is perceived, enabling photogtaphers to make informed editing decisions while respecting their creative intent. In its current state, the project is a composition analysis engine that understands the principles of visual art and human perception.

## Core Features

### 1. Visual Weight Heatmap
- Visualizes how **contrast**, **saturation**, **object positioning**, etc, influence the perceived "weight" of different regions.
- Helps identify imbalances where an image feels too "heavy" or "light."

### 2. Eye Flow Path Overlay
- Predicts natural **eye movement** across the image.
- Reveals where visual attention is drawn and highlights areas with disrupted flow or visual bottlenecks.

### 3. Aesthetic Property Histograms
- Breaks down key visual factors like **Texture**, **Shape**, **Movement**, **Color energy**, etc.
- Histograms help assess visual complexity and rhythm.

## Why It's Unique

- Goes beyond traditional editing tools by focusing on **visual structure**, not just color correction or tonal adjustments.
- Offers **no presets or auto-edits** — instead, it provides **feedback grounded in core visual art principles**.
- Uses **AI-driven, context-aware analysis** to guide photographers in making meaningful edits that respect their creative intent and compositional style.
